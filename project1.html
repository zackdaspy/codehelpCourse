                            Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived a young boy named Tom. Tom was very mischievous and would often disobey his parents. He would play outside for hours without permission and come home late at night.

One day, Tom's parents decided to teach him a lesson. They gave him a small plant and told him to take care of it. They asked him to water it every day and make sure it gets enough sunlight. 

Tom was not interested in taking care of the plant at first, but as time passed, he noticed that the plant was growing bigger and healthier. He started to take pride in his work and enjoyed watching the plant grow.

Tom's parents were very pleased with his dedication to taking care of the plant. They explained to him that just like the plant, he too needed love, attention, and care to grow and thrive. They told him that they loved him and wanted the best for him, which is why they set rules for him to follow.

Tom understood his parents' message and promised to obey them and show them the respect they deserve. He realized that his parents only wanted the best for him and that he should show them love and gratitude in return.

From that day on, Tom became a better son. He listened to his parents, followed their rules, and showed them love and respect. Tom's parents were proud of him and their relationship became stronger than ever before.

The little plant that Tom had taken care of became a symbol of the love and care he received from his parents. It reminded him that just like the plant, he needed to be loved and taken care of to grow into a happy and successful person.

And so, Tom learned a valuable lesson that would stay with him for the rest of his life: to love, respect, and obey his parents, who always had his best interests at heart.
